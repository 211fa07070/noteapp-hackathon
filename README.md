# noteapp-hackathon

This is a Project developed from the Students of Vignan's University from the branch Information Technology Department
We are formed as a batch to solve this question during a Hackathon conducted by Myra Academy as a part of CRT Training
Participants performed :
Chandan Pawan Koti (211Fa07043)
Saketh Vangara (211FA07070)

This Project discusses about the Note Application in which we displayed various Notes 
and a Plus icon to add notes

Using HTML and CSS for the FRONT END DEVELOPMENT, We have also used Javascript for creating new notes and also double clicking on a note to delete it through confirmation.
